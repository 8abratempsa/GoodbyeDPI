# MathWorks MATLAB R2017a: A Powerful Tool for Windows Users
     
MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing platform used by millions of engineers and scientists to analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models. It combines a desktop environment tuned for iterative analysis and design processes with a programming language that expresses matrix and array mathematics directly. It also includes the Live Editor for creating scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook.
     
In March 2017, MathWorks introduced Release 2017a (R2017a) of the MATLAB and Simulink product families. R2017a includes a range of new capabilities in MATLAB and Simulink, as well as updates and bug fixes to 86 other products. One of the highlights of R2017a is the new product, Automated Driving System Toolbox, which helps design, simulate, and test advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems.

R2017a also offers many new features and enhancements for MATLAB users who work on Windows operating systems. Some of these are:
     
- Interactive figure updates in the Live Editor, including title, labels, legend, and other annotations, as well as the ability to copy live script outputs to other applications.
- More functions for operating on tall arrays, including ismember, sort, conv, and moving statistics functions. Tall arrays allow you to work with data that is too large to fit in memory.
- Deep learning algorithms for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for regression tasks using multiple GPUs on PCs, on clusters, and in the cloud. You can also transfer weights from pretrained CNN models (AlexNet, VGG-16 and VGG-19) and models from Caffe Model Zoo.
- Regression Learner app for training regression models using supervised machine learning. You can choose from various algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods.
- Antenna Designer app for interactively choosing and analyzing antennas with desired characteristics. You can select from a library of parameterized antenna elements or import custom antennas from other tools.

If you are interested in trying out MATLAB R2017a on your Windows machine, you can download a free trial from the MathWorks website. You can also find more information about the new features and capabilities of R2017a in the release notes. MATLAB R2017a is a powerful tool that can help you solve complex problems and create innovative solutions with ease.
